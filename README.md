# PIC16F877A-Device-Drivers
This repository contains drivers for all the peripheral modules available on the PIC16F877A microcontroller. These drivers are written in C and are designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for controlling the various hardware features of the microcontroller.

Supported Peripherals
The following peripherals are supported by the drivers in this repository:

GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)

Simple control of digital I/O pins.
Functions for configuring pin direction (input/output), reading and writing to pins.
ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)

Supports 10-bit ADC conversion.
Functions to configure ADC channels and read analog values from the pins.
PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

Configures PWM generation using Timer2.
Functions to set duty cycle and frequency for generating PWM signals.
USART (Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)

Serial communication (UART) support for asynchronous communication.
Functions for transmitting and receiving data via the UART.
TIMERs (Timer0, Timer1, Timer2)

Timer configuration and interrupt handling for precise time delays and event triggering.
Functions to configure timer mode, prescalers, and handling overflow interrupts.
EEPROM

Supports read and write operations to the built-in data EEPROM.
Functions to store and retrieve non-volatile data.
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

Master and slave mode support for I2C communication.
Functions to initialize the I2C bus, send/receive data, and control communication.
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)

Master and slave mode support for SPI communication.
Functions for sending and receiving data over the SPI bus.
CCP (Capture/Compare/PWM)

Functions for using CCP modules to capture events, compare outputs, or generate PWM signals.
Interrupts

Configuration for internal and external interrupts.
Functions to enable and handle interrupts from peripherals and I/O pins.
